libtorrent-rasterbar (0.14.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control, debian/rules: revert building only against boost1.37 since
    the dependencies on the -dev packages are causing some problems with
    reverse depends clients and backporting to stable is not really needed
    (too much maintenance work) at the moment.
  * debian/README.source: deleted.

  * New upstream version
    - remove patch 01_python_bindings.patch (included upstream);

      description for details).

  * Install .cpp examples using dh_installexamples and a .examples file.
  * debian/copyright: fix main BSD license text.

  * New upstream version.
    - debian/copyright: new and updated copyright notes and files.
    - debian/control:
      + build-depends on libboost1.36-dev and python-dev;
      + new package libtorrent-rasterbar1 (bump up library SONAME);
      + new package python-libtorrent which contains python bindings
        for the library.
    - debian/rules:
      + use multi-threaded boost libraries (--with-boost-system=mt, ...);
      + add --disable-examples and --disable-tests options;
      + delete specific information about debian revision in dh_makeshlibs
        (i.e., use only dh_makeshlibs -V).
    - debian/control, debian/rules, debian/README.source, debian/patches:
      build-depends on quilt patch system and install a patch of mine
      (01_python_bindings, already merged upstream) in order to build python
      bindings; use a temporary fix for the 'clean' target.
  * Install example files (.cpp) with the -doc package.
  * Provide a doc-base control file to install html docs
    (libtorrent-rasterbar-doc.doc-base).
  * debian/README.Debian: new notes about the python package and the lintian
    tag 'no-symbols-control-file' for libtorrent-rasterbar1.
  * Close a bug in Ubuntu about build with --disable-debug, already solved

libtorrent-rasterbar (0.13.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - build with --disable-debug option because enabling debug seems to cause
    some clients to crash, and most upstream authors prefer a release build of
    the library.
    - added specific version information to dh_makeshlibs so that reverse
    dependencies will depend on this particular version.
  * README.Debian: updated with info about --disable-debug.
